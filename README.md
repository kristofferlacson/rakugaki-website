Personalized Japanese Bar Website A practice project I built to learn web development concepts by designing a fictional Japanese bar and restaurant website. 🍶🍣 This is not a real restaurant — it’s a creative project to experiment with layout, typography, responsiveness, and styling.

Features:

Elegant, modern design inspired by Japanese aesthetics

Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

Menu section showcasing sushi, ramen, and drinks

Simple navigation and clean structure

This project was made purely for learning purposes and to improve my front-end development skills.
